  "psi.introduction": "Welcome to Psi, the best spell programming magic tech mod in this side of the universe. Please keep in mind that having Just Enough Items (JEI) or some other method of looking up recipes is essential for playing with Psi, as recipes are not included in this guide. In order to get started spellslinging, you'll need some Psidust. To get Psidust, you need to start by crafting a CAD Assembler and an Iron CAD Assembly. Place down the CAD Assembler and put the Iron CAD Assembly in it to construct a very barebones Casting Assistance Device (CAD). From there, drop some Redstone Dust in the world. Equip your CAD, point at the dropped items and right click to make your Psidust.",

  "psi.piecegroup.tutorial1": "Tutorial 1",
  "psi.piecegroup.tutorial1.desc": "Welcome to the leveling menu, it looks like you've gotten acquainted with your brand new CAD. This menu serves as your school for the mod, and this is your first tutorial! Don't worry, this is the longest one, as it has to teach you the basics. To get started programming spells you'll need a Spell Programmer. To run your spells, you'll also need a better CAD than the one you have right now, one with all the components. Look up all the various CAD components (Assembly, Core, Socket, Battery, and optionally, Colorizer) and create one. You don't have to make another Assembly, you can put your current CAD (that is effectively just an Assembly) in your crafting grid to revert it to an Assembly.<br><br>Lastly, Spells also need to be put into Spell Bullets, so make yourself all of that stuff and let's get rolling.<br><br>After you're set with all you need. Open up your Spell Programmer by right clicking it. You'll see a large grid. This is where the magic happens. The programming system is less of a traditionally complex programming system, and more of a simple sequence of actions. To add a piece to the grid, right click any part of it, and select from the pieces that come up.<br><br>As you can see at the bottom, you have two available pieces. Once you have more, you'll be able to assemble them to create spells in a myriad of different ways, but for now, let's just focus on these two. The pieces you have available are the \"Selector: Caster\" and the \"Trick: Debug\". Tricks are the most important part of a spell, they are the means through which the spell interacts with the world. In our case, the Debug trick is an exception, as it just writes a value to the player's chat.<br><br>Start off by placing them in your grid adjacent to eachother. When you left click on your \"Selector: Caster\", you'll find that nothing special happens. However, when you do the same for your \"Trick: Debug\", a panel appears on the left where you can configure the inputs of this piece, the piece's \"parameters\". Parameters are info that goes to the piece, in order to allow it to do it's thing. Our Debug trick sends out something to chat, so we need to know what that thing is. Take the Target parameter, and click one of the arrows, so that your \"Selector: Caster\" looks like it's pointing towards the \"Trick: Debug\". If you hold Shift while looking at a piece, you can see what types of parameters it needs or what type it sends out. This is useful, so you can pair the right pieces together. Ignore the Number parameter for now, we'll cover it later.<br><br>If you've done this correctly, you should see the X on the top turns into a checkmark, and some values appear on the right. Don't worry about those for now. If you're still seeing the red X, hover over it to see what the error is and try to correct it.<br><br>Now we need to take the program you've made and send it over to your CAD. Grab your Spell Bullet and right click your Spell Programmer with it. You'll hear a beep boop, and are now ready to load the bullet. Place your new CAD into your Assembler, into the big slot on the top-left, and you'll see some slots below it open up. Place your bullet in there, then you can take your CAD out. To pick a spell, hold your CAD and hold the same key you use to access this menu. NOTE: You may only have a single CAD on you. If you have more than one in your inventory, spells will not work.<br><br>In order to level up, you need to create and cast a spell that contains the piece highlighted in red on the last thing you've learned. In our case, we need a spell with a \"Trick: Debug\" to be able to level up. Right click your CAD with your bullet loaded and you should be ready to move on. If you want to create more Psidust, simply pick a slot that has no bullet in it.",
  "psi.piecegroup.tutorial2": "Tutorial 2",
  "psi.piecegroup.tutorial2.desc": "Let's talk about the \"Number\" parameter we saw last time. You'll notice that parameter has an extra option in the center. That means the parameter is optional. By selecting the center, you can disable it.<br><br>In our case, the \"Number\" parameter is simply a label of sorts, it can be useful if we have a more complex spell where we have multiple things being sent out to chat. It requires a Number, so let's give it one. We now have access to a \"Constant: Number\" piece. Add the \"Number\" parameter to your Debug piece and add a \"Constant: Number\" piece to your grid and connect it to your Debug piece. You can set the number by clicking on the piece and just typing the number with your keyboard.<br><br>Now that we're dealing with multiple parameters, you can assume that in a more complex grid, not everything will be adjacent just as it currently is. That's where Connectors, another piece introduced here, come in. Connectors do exactly as the name says, and allow a piece to connect to another, they're like a wire. You can put a connector adjacent to a piece, and it'll transfer whatever that piece contains to whatever is on the end of the connector. You can make connectors line up with other connectors if what you need is far away. A single connector line can send the object that points to it to any other pieces that are oriented to tap on to it.<br><br>Remember, to level up, you need to make a spell using the piece highlighted in red, so you need to use your \"Constant: Number\" piece, preferably alongside the Debug trick from Tutorial 1, but give Connectors a try as well, they'll be very important later!",
  "psi.piecegroup.tutorial3": "Tutorial 3",
  "psi.piecegroup.tutorial3.desc": "Ok, ok. I know what you're thinking. \"This is boring, when do we start doing cool stuff?\" Well... now!<br><br>It's time we introduce a Trick that actually does some sort of interaction with the world. Bring in \"Trick: Add Motion\". This trick, as you'd expect, adds movement to an entity. It takes an Entity, a Vector and a Number Constant. As you should've figured out already, \"Selector: Caster\" returns an Entity (Player), which, if you'd use with your new \"Trick: Add Motion\", you could use it to add movement to your player character. The Vector is the direction in which you want the movement to be added, and the Number Constant is the speed you want to apply. Obviously, you can get this number using \"Constant: Number\".<br><br>We don't have any great tricks up our sleeve to get a vector for the trick, but we do have \"Operator: Entity Look\", which gets us a vector corresponding to the direction the player is looking. If we pass that into our \"Trick: Add Motion\", the player character will move in the direction they're looking. As for the number, go with 3 for now. You can change it of course, but 3 is a good one. You'll notice that when you modify the value of the constant, the numbers on the right change. These numbers are relevant now. They are the stats of your spell. The stats of your spell match up to those of your CAD, and if any of your spell's stats are below the stats of your CAD, you won't be able to cast the spell.<br><br>From the top to bottom, the stats are as follows:<br>§nComplexity§r: The amount of actions your spell has. Constants, connectors and Debug Tricks aren't counted.<br>§nPotency§r: The power of your spell. As you increase the power of your tricks, this goes up.<br>§nCost§r: The amount of Psi (the energy bar on the right of your screen) your spell is going to consume. This doesn't match up to any CAD stat, but is affected by the CAD's Efficiency. The actual value that is consumed is the one inside parenthesis. The higher the Efficiency of your CAD, the less extra you'll have to pay.<br>§nProjection§r: The amount of Tricks in your spell. Debug Tricks aren't counted.<br>§nBandwidth§r: The width or height of your spell, whichever is the highest. If you find you're going over this, try making your spell more compact.",
  "psi.piecegroup.tutorial4": "Tutorial 4",
  "psi.piecegroup.tutorial4.desc": "Do you like explosions? Of course you do. Let's make a spell that explodes the block the player is looking at.<br><br>For this, we are going to need \"Trick: Explode\". This takes a Vector and a Number Constant. Similarly to our \"Trick: Add Motion\", this constant is the power of the trick. The vector is where you want the explosion to happen. We already used \"Operator: Entity Look\", but that gives us a vector that's very short. If we used that, the explosion would happen in our face! Instead, we want to use an \"Operator: Vector Raytrace\".<br><br>This operator takes a position and a ray, both Vectors. From the position, which will be the player's position, acquirable through \"Operator: Entity Position\", the operator extends the \"Ray\" parameter vector until it collides with a block in the world. (Note: \"Operator: Entity Position\" returns a vector whose Y value is 1.6 higher than usual if used on a player.)<br>Therefore, if we use it alongside \"Operator: Entity Look\", we can find out where the player is looking at and create our explosion there. One thing we have to keep in mind is the fact that spells are effective to a range of 32 blocks from their focal point, in our case, the player casting the spell. Our explosion can't be farther than 32 blocks away from the player.<br><br>Lastly, the \"Error Suppressor\" piece does exactly as it describes. If something goes wrong while casting your spell, you'll get an error in your chat telling you what went wrong. Sometimes that can get annoying, when you know a spell has a possible failiure state. In that case. throw in an \"Error Suppressor\" anywhere in your spell's grid and all the errors will be gone.<br><br>This will be your last basic tutorial, from here you'll be able to pick between various things to pick as you level up.

  "psi.piecegroup.projectiles": "Alternative Casting",
  "psi.piecegroup.projectiles.desc": "Aside from the standard Spell Bullets, alternate spell bullets can be created, that allow for spells to be casted in different ways.<br><br>Projectile Spell Bullets, instead of casting the spell straight away, emit a projectile, that casts the spell upon colliding with something. Grenade Spell Bullets function similarly to the Projectile ones, but create a \"grenade\" style projectile that is affected by gravity and explodes (casting the spell) after 3 seconds of being fired. Charge Spell Bullets work like the Grenade ones, but will only cast the spell when ignited by a Spell Detonator item. Mine Spell Bullets also work like the Grenade ones, and will cast the spell once an entity walks into them and walks out. Circle Spell Bullets create a Spell Circle where the caster is looking, the spell is cast on the position of the spell circle 20 times over the course of 5 seconds.<br><br>The usage of alternative bullets like these requires the introduction of the \"Selector: Focal Point\" piece, which selects the Focal Point of the spell. For normal Spell Bullets, the Focal Point is the player itself, whereas for Projectile (or any of the derivate) Spell Bullets, the Focal Point is the projectile entity. Naturally, for Circle Spell Bullets, the Focal Point will be the spell circle. \"Selector: Caster\" always remains unchanged.<br><br>The 32 block limit on spells exists around the Focal Point, so these alternate spell bullets bullets allow for spell effects to happen farther away. Furthermore, a spell can always affect its Caster, even if the Caster is outside the 32 block radius of the Focal Point. The Spell Detonator item can only detonate charges in a 32 block radius.<br><br>The other piece of the group, \"Selector: Ruler Vector\" is to be used with a Vector Ruler. This item allows you to define a vector in world. Shift-right click a block to set the source and normal right click another to set the destination. When you use the selector, it gets the vector you selected. In the case that you have multiple Vector Rulers on you, the first one is used, hotbar taking priority.",
  "psi.piecegroup.block_works": "Blockworks",
  "psi.piecegroup.block_works.desc": "Working with blocks is an essential skill. As blocks are aligned to a grid in the world, you can refer to a block's position via a Vector, so knowledge of the Vector concepts is rather important for understanding the contents of Blockworks.<br><br>Two of the most basic pieces in this group are the \"Place Block\" and \"Break Block\" Tricks. They take a Vector and either place, and break a block in the position respective to it. For the case of \"Trick: Place Block\", the block placed is the one to the right of the player's CAD, on the hotbar. Of course, one of those blocks is taken from the player's inventory. Knowing where to place or break a block is easy, as it can be done through \"Operator: Vector Raycast\".<br><br>There is something we have to keep in mind, however. A standard implementation of \"Operator: Vector Raycast\" gives us the block the player is looking at, we can't place a block there, as one already exists! To remedy that, we can combine our \"Operator: Vector Raycast\" with the new \"Operator: Vector Axis Raycast\" piece, which gives us a vector equivalent to the side of the block we're looking at, so if we're looking at the top of the block, it'll give us a axial vector (0, 1, 0). We can then sum that, using \"Operator: Vector Sum\" to the result of our raycast to get where to place our block!<br><br>In a similar fashion, \"Operator: Entity Axial Look\" gets an axial vector equivalent to the axis the player is looking at. Think of the \"Facing\" value in your F3 menu. \"Operator: Entity Axial Look\" does something similar. Say \"Facing\" would say \"east\", then \"Operator: Entity Axial Look\" would get you a vector (1, 0, 0). This, unlike the \"Facing\" value also detects when you're looking up and down.<br><br>The other two tricks available here are \"Trick: Place Block Sequence\" and \"Trick: Break Block Sequence\", the latter being the red piece for this group. These tricks break or place a line of blocks. Similarly to the standard break and place tricks, they require a position to start off, but they also require another Vector, \"Target\", that defines the line in which it should interact. So if \"Target\" is (0, 4, 0), it'll place or break 4 blocks up, starting from the value of \"Position\". The last component to these tricks is \"Max\", this is a number constant for the maximum amount of blocks the trick is allowed to break or place. Since the vector requirements aren't constant, this works as means of calculating the Potency and Cost of the trick. The higher you set it, the more the spell will cost.<br><br>The last piece in this group is \"Operator: Vector Project\". Vector Projection is a somewhat complex topic, so this will only explain one of the potential uses for it, that being projecting a vector onto an axis. Imagine you want to make a spell that places blocks from your position in the world to the position you're looking at, but in a straight line aligned to the side of the block you're lookig at (using \"Operator: Vector Axis Raycast\"). You start off by getting the vector that you want to place blocks on, for using \"Trick: Place Block Sequence\", but if you're diagonal to the block, you may get something like (3, 2, 4). That's not a straight line! We can use \"Operator: Vector Project\" to project that into the axis of the side you're looking at, say, (0, 0, 1). So our \"Vector A\" is (3, 2, 4) and our \"Vector B\" is (0, 0, 1). Applying the projection leaves us with (0, 0 4). If our \"Vector B\", was, for example, (1, 0, 0), we'd get (3, 0, 0). For the case where an axial vector is used in B, Vector Projection strips any parts of A that are 0 in B. We can then do our straight line.<br><br>As the red piece in this group is \"Trick: Break Block Sequence\", you won't need anything too crazy for the most part. Try making a spell that brings down an 8 block high column, so you can \"treecapitate\".",

When a spell is cast from a Loopcast Spell Bullet, it executes as if it was cast from a normal one, but also puts the player into a \"loopcasting\" state, where, until they unequip their CAD, will continuously cast the same spell at a rate of 4 times a second. The advantage of loopcasting is the fact that the initial cooldown to psi regeneration is only applied on the first spell in full. For each subsequent cast, the cooldown will be much shorter than usual, so, given a caster with a high enough level to sustain psi regeneration to cover the cost of a spell, said spell can be endlessly loopcasted.<br><br>The red piece of this group is \"Selector: Loopcast Index\". This piece selects the amount of times a spell has been loopcasted. For the initial cast this will be 0, and will be incremented once for every subsequent loopcast. This can be used alongside \"Operator: Modulus\" and \"Operator: Integer Division\" to alter how the spell functions every time it's cast.<br><br>\"Operator: Integer Division\" does exactly as it says on the tin, and executes division of the integer parts of the two numbers. \"Operator: Modulus\" calculates the remainer of the division of the integer parts of the two numbers.

  "psi.piecegroup.flow_control": "Flow Control",
  "psi.piecegroup.flow_control.desc": "Flow Control is a somewhat complex subject. All the pieces here included allow for a spell to function in wildly different manners from what was available in your arsenal before. However, understanding how to properly use these pieces requires knowledge of the very internals of the spellcasting system. There are a few basic rules to be taken in mind to properly understand these concepts:<br>1. Spells execute in the order that the arrows drawn in the Spell Programmer point towards.<br>2. Any given piece's value will only be evaulated once. Any further pieces that require its value will just get the value evaluated the first time. For example, 3 instances of \"Trick: Debug\" pointing to the same \"Operator: Random\" will all print out the same value, as the random output will only be evaluted once.<br>3. A piece will only be evaluated when another piece requires its value. These chains are triggered by the Trick pieces.<br>4. Tricks are always executed from left to right and top to bottom. Therefore, a Trick in the second row will always be executed after a trick in the first.<br><br>With that in mind, let's start off with the red piece of this group, \"Trick: Sleep\". This piece causes the spell to delay any further execution for the amount of ticks passed in. Knowing the order in which tricks execute, thanks to rule 4, putting this in the right place shouldn't be too hard. For those unaware, a Tick is a 1/20 fraction of a second. So if you wish to delay further processing of a spell by half a second, you would use 10 as the \"Time\" parameter. \"Trick: Sleep\" does not add any Projection to your spell, but does add Potency.<br><br>\"Trick: Evaluate\" is a trick that does absolutely nothing. Yes, you heard that right. This trick does nothing. It doesn't increment any stats on your spell either. Its only application is to make use of rule 2, and evaluate a value before a Sleep is executed, allowing you to, for example, get the position where an entity was, with \"Selector: Entity Position\", before the Sleep is applied, for a trick used after said Sleep.<br><br>\"Trick: Die\" is a Flow Control piece in the proper sense of the term. It takes a simple Number parameter, and if that number lies between -1 (exclusive) and 1 (also exclusive) it'll stop the spell's execution right then and there. Any other values will have the spell continue as usual. This piece doesn't add Projection. A very simple way to put it to use is to utilize \"Selector: Sneak Status\", which convinentely gives you 0 if the caster is sneaking and 1 if they're not. Almost as if they were made to go together!<br><br>\"Constant: Wrapper\" allows you to make use of Number type pieces for tricks that would otherwise require a Number Constant. As you should know by now, the constant value given to a trick allows for calculation of the various stats of the spell before you even cast it, this being the normal reason variable numbers can't be fed into a trick. \"Constant: Wrapper\" requires two numbers, a constant one and a normal one. The constant value given to the piece will be the one used for any statistical calculation, whereas the normal number will be the one used for when the spell is actually put into use. The normal number's value will be capped out at the value of the constant one during spell execution, to prevent any sort of tomfoolery. The normal number is also always converted to a positive or negative number, depending on the sign of the constant number, so that the signs of both numbers match. If the constant number is 0, the result of this evaluation is always 0, regardless of the value of the normal number.",

The red piece of the group falls under the \"focus\" area, however, in order to understand it, the concept of Slot Focus must be introduced.<br><br>An already known example of Slot Focus is the family of Place Block style tricks. These make use of the block directly to the left of your CAD. Slot Focus is the slot which tricks like these will use. It can be relative (to the position of your CAD) or absolute, can only be in the hotbar and goes from 1 to 9. By default, whenever a spell is cast, it's value is \"Relative 1\", so it's 1 slot to the right of your CAD. If it was \"Relative -1\" it would be 1 slot to the right of your CAD. \"Absolute 3\" would be the third slot in your hotbar. It also loops around, so if you have your CAD on your last slot and the value is \"Relative 1\", it'll be your first slot.<br><br>To set the focused slot, you can use \"Trick: Switch Focus Slot\", the red piece of this group. This takes one of 2 parameters. Both are optional and mutually exclusive, and if you don't define any, it'll set the focus to the default of \"Relative 1\". If you choose to set the \"Position\" parameter, it'll set an Absolute value, whereas the \"Shift\" parameter will set a Relative value. This allows you to, for example, build things with different blocks based on the circumstance. This trick only works for the current spell cast, and the focus will reset on the next time a spell is cast (even if it's the same spell).<br><br>The other two pieces in the group are set in the \"detection\" area. First, \"Selector: Item Presence\" takes an optional slot number (if not set it'll default to your Focused Slot), and returns the amount of items in that slot, 0 if it's empty, of course. Lastly, \"Selector: Block Presence\" takes a vector, to be used as coordinates in the world, and finds the block there, the value returned is 0 if there's no block or a replaceable block (like tall grass), 1 if it's a non-solid block and 2 if it's a solid block.",
